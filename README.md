This algorithm was generated from a given problem.

This algorithm takes a number N and generates 1,2...,N random numbers without replacement.
We append the first generated random number into an empty list.
Then after, we append in the list, absolute difference between a generated random number and that precedes it.
Finally, we find the sum.
We repeat the process but find standard deviation of the list rather than the sum.
